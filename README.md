# 🩺 Medical Recommendation System

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook that builds a basic **Medical Recommendation System** using machine learning techniques to assist in diagnosing potential medical conditions and suggesting treatments based on input symptoms.

## 📁 Project Structure

- `Medical_Recommendation.ipynb`: The main notebook containing all the code for data preprocessing, model training, and prediction.
- `README.md`: Project overview and setup guide.

## 🚀 Features

- Data Cleaning & Preprocessing
- Symptom-based Diagnosis
- Disease Prediction using ML algorithms (e.g., Decision Trees, Random Forest, etc.)
- Treatment/Recommendation Suggestions
- Visualization of Model Accuracy and Predictions

## 📊 Technologies Used

- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook

## 🧠 Machine Learning Models

- Decision Tree Classifier
- Random Forest Classifier
- Support Vector Machines (optional depending on the notebook content)
- Model Evaluation (Accuracy, Confusion Matrix)

## 🛠️ Setup Instructions

To run the notebook locally:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/medical-recommendation-system.git
